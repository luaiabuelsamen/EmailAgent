# Cognitive Email Ecosystem

A hierarchical agent-based approach to email management that processes emails in layers rather than all at once.

## Overview

The Cognitive Email Ecosystem is a novel approach to email management using a multi-layer agent architecture inspired by human cognitive processes. Rather than feeding an entire inbox into a single LLM agent, this system employs specialized agents that work in a hierarchical structure:

1. **Observer Agent**: Maintains a mental model of user behavior patterns and learns from past interactions
2. **Context Agent**: Analyzes external factors like calendar, time, and location
3. **Social Graph Agent**: Maps and understands social relationships in the email network
4. **Intent Decoder**: Determines the underlying purpose behind an email
5. **Execution Specialists**: Task-specific agents for handling particular types of emails

## Key Benefits

- **Contextual Understanding**: Emails are prioritized based on both content and external context
- **Adaptive Learning**: System improves over time by observing user behavior patterns
- **Social Intelligence**: Considers organizational relationships and communication patterns
- **Intent-Based Processing**: Focuses on the purpose behind communications rather than just keywords
- **Specialized Handling**: Task-specific agents handle different types of emails appropriately

## Components

### Observer Agent

Acts as the "prefrontal cortex" of the system, maintaining a model of the user's behavior patterns:
- Tracks response times for different senders
- Identifies priority contacts based on quick user responses
- Learns which patterns the user tends to ignore
- Records historical decisions to improve future predictions

### Context Agent

Acts as the "situational awareness" component, analyzing external factors:
- Checks calendar events for meeting conflicts
- Considers user location (office, home, traveling)
- Accounts for device being used (mobile, desktop)
- Respects focus mode settings (Do Not Disturb, Focused Work)

### Social Graph Agent

Acts as the "social intelligence" component, mapping relationships:
- Builds a network of communication connections
- Understands organizational hierarchies
- Recognizes team memberships
- Tracks communication frequency between contacts

### Intent Decoder

Acts as the "empathy" component, understanding communication purposes:
- Identifies emails requesting action
- Recognizes approval requests
- Spots information sharing messages
- Detects urgent/escalation communications
- Finds scheduling requests

### Execution Specialists

Act as the "motor cortex" to execute specific tasks:
- Meeting Scheduler: Proposes available meeting times
- Approval Processor: Prepares approval responses
- Information Gatherer: Collects needed information
- Action Tracker: Tracks requested actions
- Emergency Handler: Handles urgent communications

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install flask
```

2. Run the demonstration interface:
```
python email_interface.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Implementation Details

This implementation is a prototype to demonstrate the concept. In a production environment:

- The Intent Decoder would use a sophisticated LLM rather than keyword matching
- Email fetching from actual email providers would be integrated
- Machine learning models would be trained on the user's historical data
- More execution specialists would be available for different tasks
- Integration with calendars, task managers, and other productivity tools

## Future Directions

- **Cognitive Memory**: Implementing short-term, long-term, and working memory concepts
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Understanding emotional tone and responding appropriately
- **Cross-Service Integration**: Connecting with other productivity tools
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Making proactive recommendations based on patterns
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Learning from organizational patterns across users
